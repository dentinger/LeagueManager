# LeagueManager
Small project to test different graph databases and different strategies of graph database bulk loading.

## Prerequisites

This project requires the following:

1. Java 8
2. Gradle
3. Local install of Neo4J

## Overview

Ingesting large amounts of data in any database is difficult and there are few good
resources for testing loading techniques in NOSQL databases. To help investigate
different loading strategies in different Graph database technologies, we have decided
to model the relationships of the ever popular SportsBall teams.  The data model for
SportsBall teams and their Leagues will be:

 * People (Types: Player, Coach, Fan) are associated with one or more Teams
 * Teams play in one or more Leagues
 * Regions contain one or more Leagues

 ![League Manager Model](./docs/LeagueManagerModel.png)

SportsBall is the worlds most popular, full contact, high speed sporting extravaganza that delivers
a competitive advantage through continuous excitement delivery at a speed that matters.

## Loading approaches for Neo4j

Several approaches are being tested to show how the database handles different amounts of data as
well as loading approaches.  Unless noted, all of these approaches will chunk data to be inserted into
uniform sets of data and then process each chunk of data using some form of asynchronous processing.
These approaches also assume that indexes are created for the node types. Note that in early commits to
LeagueManager this was not being done properly and as a result performance suffered.

### Basic first pass with UNWIND

This approach uses the UNWIND statement with nodes and relationships being created together.
An example of this approach:

```
unwind {json} as league
    unwind league.regions as region
      merge (r:Region {id: region.id})â€¨
      merge (l:League {id: league.id})
        on create set l.name = league.name
      merge (r)-[:SANCTION]-(l);
```

### Node First with UNWIND
This approach still uses unwind but first tries to create nodes that are known and then it will create relationships that are known. This is a two pass approach. An example would be run node cypher statement then run
relationship statement.

```
private String MERGE_LEAGUES_NODE =
    "unwind {json} as league "
        + "unwind league.regions as region "
        + "    merge (l:League {id: league.id})"
        + "     on create set l.name = league.name ";

private String MERGE_LEAGUES_RELATIONSHIPS =
    "unwind {json} as league "
        + "unwind league.regions as region "
        + "   match (r:Region {id: region.id})"
        + "    match (l:League {id: league.id})"
        + "    merge (r)-[:SANCTION]-(l)";
```

## Handling large data and deadlocks
As part of the process of loading large (or even small to medium) amounts of data into Neo4j the dreaded deadlock can be encountered.

To work around this, we've introduced a new class called RetriableTask.
```
Syntax: new RetriableTask().retries(3).delay(200, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
                    .step(500, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).execute()
```
* retries = the number of times to retry on exception
* delay = the amount of time to wait between retries
* skip = the upper limit of random time to add to delay to randomize the amount of time we wait between retries.
* execute = accepts implementation of the Supplier or Runnable interface.

## How to use

There are a handful of properties that drive the loading of data in LeagueManager.  All of these
can be set/updated in the application.yml file.
For a full set of properties currently set look in ![application.yml](./src/main/resources/application.yml).
There are a few properties that have a more impact on the behavior of the app.  These include:

* regions.loading.threads - how many threads will load regions into database.
* leagues.loading.threads - how many threads will load leagues into database.
* teams.loading.threads - how many threads will load teams into database.
* neo4j.url - url to the neo4j install
* neo4j.username - neo4j user
* neo4j.password - password for neo4j.user

There are three ways that the project can be run:

* From Command Line
* From IDE
* From a Docker image.

### General application parameters

|Functionality |JVM parameter |Description|
|---|---|---|
| Remove all LeagueManager nodes | cleanup | Delete all nodes and relationships from the DB |
| Load All data | loadAll  |Run all loaders in the application.   |
| Load League data  | loadLeagues  | Only load league data to the application.  |
| Load Region data  | loadRegions  | Only load region data to the application. |
| Load Team data | loadTeams | Only load team data to the application. |
| Load Person data | loadPersons | Only load team data to the application |
| Run Node First insertion | nodeFirst | Run using the node first approach for loaders.  The node first algorithm can be used with all loadAll or any of the individual load types.|

### Command line and IDE Running:

To run the project from the command line, first do a ```gradle clean build```.  Then you can use any
of the general application parameters passed in on the command line.

If running from the an IDE, the program arguments would use any of the general program arguments.

Sample usage: *java -jar leagueManager-0.0.1-RELEASE.jar loadLeagues loadRegions*

Sample usage of Node First approach: *java -jar leagueManager-0.0.1-RELEASE.jar nodeFirst loadLeagues loadRegions*

Sample Cleanup usage: *java -jar leagueManager-0.0.1-RELEASE.jar cleanup*

This will load the leagues and regions into the application.

### Docker execution

To run with docker you will have to update your local install of Neo4j.  The configuration of Neo4j
will need to be changed to allow non localhost connections for HTTP.  To do this, cd to into the config
directory for your Neo4j install.  Edit the neo4j.properties so that following line is uncommented:
```
# To have HTTP accept non-local connections, uncomment this line
dbms.connector.http.address=0.0.0.0:7474
```
This will allow non local connections which is needed for docker to access Neo4j. As a benefit, the configuration changed to make docker work also allows the project to connect to any Neo4j instance. All that is needed is to override the spring boot properties for Neo4j.  For docker this means that the neo4j.url will be specified as an environment variable in the docker container at run time.

 Steps to run in docker:

* ```./gradlew clean build```
*  ```docker build -t _**put a tag name here**_ . #note that that the . is needed```
* ```docker run  --rm -e "neo4j.url=http://*your ip*:7474/" -t -i -p 8080:8080 _**put a tag name here**_```

This will run the application in docker.  By default no parameters are passed to the application so nothing loads.
Right now the web interface only supports NodeFirst processing.
You can load data by going to your browser and hitting the following url:

* Run a cleanup: [http://localhost:8080//leaguemanager/load?cleanup=cleanup&nodeFirst=nodeFirst](http://localhost:8080//leaguemanager/load?cleanup=cleanup&nodeFirst=nodeFirst)
* Load regions: [http://localhost:8080//leaguemanager/load?cleanup=cleanup&nodeFirst=nodeFirst&loadRegions=loadRegions](http://localhost:8080//leaguemanager/load?cleanup=cleanup&nodeFirst=nodeFirst&loadRegions=loadRegions)

The current pattern (and not the best) is to pass a request parameter equal to itself for any of
the general application parameters.

## Sample Queries on the data

### Recommend a different team to become a fan of

You favorite team might not be doing well or you are wanting to impress your teammates with
how much you know about their favorite teams.  How can you find all the teams to consider?
By running the following query on your team you can find the answer. You just have to substitute
your teamId and playerId in the two spots they are required

```
match (team:Team) - [plays_on:PLAYS_ON] - (player:Person) - [fan_of:FAN_OF] - (fav_team:Team)
where team.teamId = {teamId}
with team, collect(fav_team) as players_favorites, collect(player) as team_players
with team, collect({team_players: team_players, favorites: players_favorites}) as units
unwind units as unit
  unwind unit.team_players as tp
   unwind unit.favorites as potential_team
    match (t:Team {teamId: potential_team.teamId}) where NOT((team)-[:PLAYS_ON] - (tp) - [:FAN_OF] - (potential_team) )
  with team, tp as player, collect(t) as potential_teams_for_player
where player.personId = {playerId}
return player, potential_teams_for_player
```
### Give recommendations to the whole team
You want to your team to be a cohesive Sportsball team and want/need everyone to like the same
teams.  Well were is the query to tell you what other teams each player on a team should become
fans of as well.
 ```
 match (team:Team) - [plays_on:PLAYS_ON] - (player:Person) - [fan_of:FAN_OF] - (fav_team:Team)
 where team.teamId = {teamId}
 with team, collect(fav_team) as players_favorites, collect(player) as team_players
 with team, collect({team_players: team_players, favorites: players_favorites}) as units
 unwind units as unit
   unwind unit.team_players as tp
    unwind unit.favorites as potential_team
     match (t:Team {teamId: potential_team.teamId}) where NOT((team)-[:PLAYS_ON] - (tp) - [:FAN_OF] - (potential_team) )
   with team, tp as player, collect(t) as potential_teams_for_player
 with team , collect( [player, potential_teams_for_player]) as player_recs
 return team, player_recs
 ```
This is a generalized form of the previous query.
